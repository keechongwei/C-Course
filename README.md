# C++ Deep Dive ‚Äî Practice Repository

This repository contains my implementations, exercises, and notes from the Udemy course  
**Learn C++ Programming ‚Äì Beginner to Advance ‚Äì Deep Dive in C++** by Abdul Bari.  

It demonstrates my progression through the core topics of C++ ‚Äî from fundamental data types and control flow all the way to object-oriented programming, templates, STL, exceptions, and a capstone **Banking System project**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **dataTypes/**  
  Covers C++ primitive types, variables, operators, expressions, enums, typedefs, and bitwise operations.

- **Section_5_C++_Basics/**  
  Basics of writing C++ programs, precedence rules, conditional statements, loops, and control flow.

- **Section_8_Arrays/**  
  Single- and multi-dimensional arrays, searching (linear, binary), sorting, and array-based algorithms.

- **Section_10_Strings/**  
  C-style strings and `std::string`, string manipulation methods, iterators, substring operations, and parsing.

- **Section_11_Functions/**  
  Function definitions, overloading, default arguments, templates, inline functions, recursion, and scope management.

- **Section_12_13_OOPS/**  
  Core OOP concepts: classes, objects, constructors/destructors, operator overloading, encapsulation, and data hiding.

- **Section_14_15_16_Inheritance/**  
  Inheritance models, constructor chaining, base-class pointers, polymorphism with virtual functions, and abstract classes.

- **Section_17_Friends_Inner_Static/**  
  Friend functions/classes, static members, and nested/inner class usage.

- **Section_18_ExceptionHandling/**  
  Exception handling with `try/catch`, throw mechanics, multiple catch blocks, and error safety.

- **Section_19_Templates/**  
  Function and class templates for generic programming and type-safe reuse.

- **Section_20_Constants_Preprocessor_Namespaces/**  
  Usage of `const`, macros, preprocessor directives, and organizing code with namespaces.

- **Section_21_Streams_IO/**  
  Input/output streams, file handling, text vs binary I/O, and serialization.

- **Section_23_STL/**  
  Standard Template Library: vectors, lists, stacks, queues, sets, maps, and algorithms.

- **Final_Project/**  
  A simple **Banking System** console application that integrates OOP, exception handling, file I/O, and STL containers.

## üöÄ Skills Demonstrated

- Core C++ syntax and semantics (data types, loops, functions).  
- Object-Oriented Programming (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).  
- Operator overloading, friend classes, and static/inner classes.  
- Generic programming with **templates**.  
- Robust programs with **exception handling**.  
- File handling and streams (text & binary).  
- Practical use of the **STL** (containers, algorithms, iterators).  
- Application of **C++11 features** like lambdas and smart pointers (in relevant exercises).  
- Building a complete project (Banking System) tying together all major concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

### Compile a single file
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra Section_10_Strings/string_methods.cpp -o string_methods
./string_methods
```

## üìú Notes

### All code here is original practice I wrote while following the course.

### The structure mirrors the course sections for easy navigation.

### This repository acts both as a portfolio of C++ fundamentals and a reference library for future projects.
